# 1. Get Started

## 1.1 Install & Import

**Install**

This project had been uploaded to Pypi registry so you can directly download it:

```shell
pip install keqing-sword
```

Or you can download from some mirror of Pypi if you found it hard to connect to Internet, such as TUNA in China:

```shell
pip install keqing-sword -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

Besides, if you don't trust them all, you also can Install by git clone.

**Import**

When you want to do anything with Keqing, a beautiful girl from Genshin world, you need to call her waifu.

So import this before do anything:

```python
from kqs.waifu import Waifu
```

## 1.2 Read file

Keqing offer you different kind of file IO stream, such as file/memory text/network as input stream.

Also it will bring more output stream other than save file. (Maybe network API upload?)

But now, let's started with reading exist local file.

At first we should created a object for Waifu class:

```python
map = Waifu()
map.read_file("YOUR_OSM_FILE")
```

Then waiting for some time, this will differ from file size.
