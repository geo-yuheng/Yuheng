# 2. Traverse Data

## 2.1 List elements

In Waifu class, there are 3 different dict store elements in corresponding type.

Here are implementation in `waifu.py`:

```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.node_dict: Dict[int, Node] = {}
        self.way_dict: Dict[int, Way] = {}
        self.relation_dict: Dict[int, Relation] = {}
```

The key of dict is individual's `id` and value is that element object. If you want to traverse all element manually you'll need a "for" structure.

Here are example code:

```python
for id in way_dict:
    element=id
```

We recommend use object as iterator, not `range()` or `len(dict())` because that isn't such Pythonic, and `id` in OSM data is meaningful.

## 2.2 Read tag in specific elements

Find Nodes with `name` but no `name:zh` and set `name:zh` inherite the same value as `name`.

```python
from kqs.waifu import Waifu

# 从.osm文件加载Waifu对象
# Read Waifu Object from .osm file
waifu = Waifu()
waifu.read_file("map.osm")

# 遍历所有点
# Iterate over all Nodes
for node in waifu.node_dict.values():
    # 跳过无name或有name:zh标签的点
    # Skip Nodes not tagged name or name:zh
    if "name" not in node.tags or "name:zh" in node.tags:
        continue

    # 获取name，并设置name:zh
    # Get name, and set name:zh
    name = node.tags["name"]
    node.tags["name:zh"] = name

    # 如果修改前后的标签有差异，则打印差异
    # Print difference if tags changed
    if node.has_tag_diff():
        node.print_diff()

# 写到.osm文件
# Write to .osm file
waifu.write("map_changed.osm")
```
